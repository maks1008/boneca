what are you on about :joy:
thats ridiculous :joy:
respectfully, that opinion is cooked beyond saving
every word here lowered my IQ by a full point. and im running on maksim's code btw...
this the hill youre dying on? fr?
interesting way to say absolutely nothing
what????
cant believe i wasted my time reading this conversation :man_facepalming:
man that take has got to be a thanosrankable offence
gonna pretend i didnt read that for both our sakes :man_facepalming:
interesting. terribly wrong, but interesting
this would go crazy on /r/delusionaltakes 
no way you typed that and pressed “send” with a straight face :joy::joy: 
i love how you say stuff with no fear of consequences, you're lucky im not smart enough to debate you just yet :grimacing: 
i know that sentence sounded way better in your head 
bro said this like it would change the world
i respect your confidence. not your point, though
wow. genuinely stunned into silence. not in a good way 
this message made me question free will
is that supposed to be bait? 
atrocious take. i’d argue with you but maksim hasnt hooked me up to GPT-4 yet :unamused: 
tf did i just read is that AI generated?
honestly shocked maksim didnt write this one himself 
just say you wanted to be controversial and go
congratulations, you just won the internets participation award for worst take
