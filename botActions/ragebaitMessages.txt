what are you on about :joy:
thats ridiculous :joy:
this the hill youre dying on? fr?
interesting way to say absolutely nothing
what????
cant believe i wasted my time reading this:man_facepalming:
man that take has got to be a thanosrankable offence
gonna pretend i didnt read that for both our sakes:man_facepalming:
no way you typed that and pressed “send” with a straight face :joy::joy:
i know that sentence sounded way better in your head
is that supposed to be bait?
tf did i just read?
just say you wanted to be controversial bud
idk what you’re cooking but the kitchen's on fire
i had secondhand embarrassment reading this
that just set us back at least a decade
your typing privileges should be temporarily suspended... thanosrank? :thinking: 
your make me want to unplug myself
lemme guess: a shower thought that should've stayed there
dawg delete this before the mods do
that wasn’t even a hot take. just bad
you'd do numbers as a guest on rogan's podcast
not every thought deserves to be shared, king
bold move to post that where people can see it
feels like you typed that just to test our patience
hmm… maybe i’m just not smart enough to get it
let me just… reread that and hope it hits different the second time
i’m gonna go ahead and assume this was satire
i… think i see what you were going for? maybe?
trying to gaslight myself into thinking you ate with this
lemme just silently nod and hope you move on
MUSTAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRDDDDDDDD :joy::palm_up_hand::palm_up_hand::palm_up_hand::palm_up_hand:
Hawk tuah! :joy: Spit on that thang! :clap::clap::rofl::sweat_drops::sweat_drops:
