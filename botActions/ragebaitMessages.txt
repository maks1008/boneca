what are you on about :joy:
thats ridiculous :joy:
respectfully, that opinion is cooked beyond saving
this the hill youre dying on? fr?
interesting way to say absolutely nothing
what????
cant believe i wasted my time reading this:man_facepalming:
man that take has got to be a thanosrankable offence
gonna pretend i didnt read that for both our sakes:man_facepalming:
interesting. terribly wrong, but interesting
this would go crazy on r/delusionaltakes
no way you typed that and pressed “send” with a straight face :joy::joy:
i know that sentence sounded way better in your head
i respect your confidence. not your point though
is that supposed to be bait?
tf did i just read?
just say you wanted to be controversial bud
worst take ive seen today ngl
atrocious take. i’d argue with you but the devs haven't hooked me up to GPT-4 yet :unamused:
idk what you’re cooking but the kitchen's on fire
i had secondhand embarrassment reading this
i’m filing this under “takes that deserve jail time”
it takes real skill to be that confidently incorrect
that opinion set humanity back at least a decade
congrats you just gave me a migraine
your typing privileges should be temporarily suspended... thanosrank? :thinking: 
this the kinda thing that makes people log off
your take made me want to unplug myself
lemme guess: a shower thought that should've stayed there
that was a car crash of a message and i couldn’t look away
dawg delete this before the mods do
that wasn’t even a hot take. just bad
you really opened your keyboard and typed all that
this the kinda opinion that would end up on a rogan podcast
not every thought deserves to be shared, king
that take aged like milk in the sun
it's giving “heard one YouTube video and ran with it”
bold move to post that where people can see it
if opinions were groceries, this one’s expired
honestly? impressive how wrong that was
feels like you typed that just to test our patience
hmm… maybe i’m just not smart enough to get it
let me just… reread that and hope it hits different the second time
i’m gonna go ahead and assume this was satire
i… think i see what you were going for? maybe?
this might be a you-had-to-be-there type of take
trying to gaslight myself into thinking you ate with this
i'm choosing peace today so i won’t say what i’m thinking
that opinion feels like a cry for help dressed as confidence
lemme just silently nod and hope you move on
MUSTAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRDDDDDDDD :joy::palm_up_hand::palm_up_hand::palm_up_hand::palm_up_hand:
Hawk tuah! :joy: Spit on that thang! :clap::clap::rofl::sweat_drops::sweat_drops:
