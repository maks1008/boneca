# 🐸 BONECA AMBALABU - DISCORD'S FIRST ETHICAL RAGEBAIT BOT
> *Why start arguments on the internet when a bot can do it for you?*

## WHY BOTHER?

A ragebait bot is a fun way to boost Discord server engagement, create memorable moments and put smile on people's faces. Needless to say, a project of this nature can spiral out of control and become a harassment tool; the opposite of what we're trying to achieve. With this in mind, I have developed an ethical code:
- No offensive or vulgar language
- No targeting individuals
- No hate speech against any group of people
- Consent must be obtained before the bot interacts with a user
- User feedback is to be taken seriously

Not only does this ensure that Boneca never becomes malicious, but the ethical code forces a deep level of creativity during the development process in order to create the most impactful end product possible.

## ALPHA RELEASE
Boneca is currently in its alpha release meaning that it is available to a small circle of people to assess its fitness for use. Once the bot is loaded with (well tested) features, there will be a formal link to invite Boneca to your server and a guide on how to use the source code to host Boneca yourself.
